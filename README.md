This is a bad clone of Brick Breaker tan, a mobile game I played instead of working in class when we were studying differential equations.
I intended on having triangular tiles to destroy but I failed at implementing the math for collisions
(I also have very rarely projectiles which get stuck inside blocks and delete them instantly but shhhhh it's a feature)
